database server(hardware and software) used to run database:  backend portion of database application

field,table, column
record->entire dataset
view->virtual tables(practice it!!)
why we need view?
-> to restrict the data accessibility
-> reducing redundant view

conceptual data model-> identifies highest level of relationship between different entities.
Logical data model-> includes all entites and relationship among them(normalization occurs here)
- resolve many-to-many relationships
- find all attributes for each entites
Physical data model-> how the model will be built in database.(demnormalization may be there  based on user requirements)

Acid properties(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

Stored procedure:
1. used for one shot
(can contain business logic)

syntax:
create procedure procedure_name [ (parameter datatype [,parameter datatype])] 
begin
declaration_section
executable_section
end;

call procedure:

call procedure_name (@variable_name)
select @variable_name

drop procedure (if exists) procedure_name;



summarizing the data:
select aggregate_func ((All|distinct) expression) from table_name

grouping data:
select column_list from table_name where condition [group by [all] expression ,[expression]] having search_condition

A   B
1   1  
1   2  
1   3
2   2

Inner join= 6 records
left outer join= 6 records
right outer join=7 records

create temporary table  new_table_name  as (select c1,c2,.... from old_table_name)
creating it for limited purpose (need not to be stored for longer time)

alter view view_name as select columns from tables [where conditions]

create [or replace] view view_name as select columns from tables [where conditions]
(dbms only updates meta data)
